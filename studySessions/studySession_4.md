## Challenges!

a)<a name="fibo"></a> **FINAL!**We turn back to numbers...
So, we want do a programm that execute the Fibonacci serie
https://www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/fibonacci-sequence.html

```
NºINICI = 0;
0 (NºINICI+0)
1 
1 
2 
3 
5
8
.
.
.
```

b) You can add the position of all sums?

```
0, pos 0
1, pos 1
1, pos 2
2, pos 3
3, pos 4
5, pos 5
8, pos 6

```

c) You can now specify the number of loops that the function must do?
```
function Fibo(10){
    ...
}
0
1
1
2
3
.
.
.
55 - pos 10º

```

d) **Simple Scripting program**. Create a program that transform a 4 number values code to diferents positions, making a new code.
Something like: 
3712 
:point_down:
7123
:point_down:
1237
:point_down:
2371
The first, go to the last position, second, third and four goes up.

*Hint:* Is necessary use FOR, IF and Array technolgies seen in precourse.

e) **Super-Challenge!!**
Create a program that use the Roman form for encrypt messages, how is that? Simple. If you have SKYLAB, the encrypted form is  SLKAYB...
If you divided the word in two groups of 3 letters, you get:
SKY
|-|-|
LAB 
Then, join the S with L, K with A and Y with B, and you get SLKAYB.

So, make a program that, receive the message SKYLAB and returns the SLKAYB.

f) Now, you can do the DECRYPTER? Pass the ENCRYPTED message (SLKAYB) and returns SKYLAB.
 **Hint:**: for decrypt, only catch the pair words like: **S**L**K**A**Y**B
 , then, you get SKY, the next step is catch the odd words, S**L**K**A**Y**B**
 group the two groups and you get the original word.

g) Group the **Encrypt** and **decrypt** functions in one unique function, pass the word SKYLAB and returns SKYLAB (with all the transformation...)

h) **You got it?** Then try now with SKYLABCODERS. Reform the program for can accept more large words.
